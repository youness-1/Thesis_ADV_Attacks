Instagram-inspired attacks to object detection

Object detection is a technology that is used to detect instances of objects in images
or videos. Today this technology is well established and it is applied in numerous
territories of image processing, including picture retrieval, security, observation, com-
puterized vehicle systems and machine investigation. This raises many concerns as we
depend more and more from a technology that is still vulnerable to attacks and that
can also be used to extract unauthorized information from our data, especially from
the images shared on Social Media.
In this work, we propose a black-box adversarial-filter-based attack towards some
state-of-the-art object detectors (i.e. YOLO and DETR). Unlike most adversarial
attack techniques found in literature that add small perturbations that cannot be
easily detected by human eyes but can be easily recognized by software, our filter
composition cannot be distinguished from any other filter composition used extensively
every day to enhance photos and images.

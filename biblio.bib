abstract="Recent studies have shown that Deep Leaning models are susceptible to adversarial examples, which are data, in general images, intentionally modified to fool a machine learning classifier. In this paper, we present a multi-objective nested evolutionary algorithm to generate universal unrestricted adversarial examples in a black-box scenario. The unrestricted attacks are performed through the application of well-known image filters that are available in several image processing libraries, modern cameras, and mobile applications. The multi-objective optimization takes into account not only the attack success rate but also the detection rate. Experimental results showed that this approach is able to create a sequence of filters capable of generating very effective and undetectable attacks.",

abstract = {Privacy is an important issue raised from the diffusion of deep learning models. These models are able to extract unauthorized information from our data, especially from the images shared on Social Networks. In this work we present a nested evolutionary algorithm able to optimize sequences of Instagram-style image filters that, when applied to an image, are able to protect it by fooling classification systems: we turn adversarial attacks into a defence form. Differently from other adversarial techniques adding small perturbations that cannot be easily detected by human eyes but can be easily recognized by softwares, our filter composition cannot be distinguished from any other filter composition used extensively every day to enhance photos and images.},
